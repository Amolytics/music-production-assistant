# Frontend Skeleton

This folder will contain the client-side code for your music production assistant. Typical structure:

- src/ (React/Vue/Angular app source)
- public/ (static assets)
- package.json (dependencies and scripts)
- index.html (main entry point)

You can use React, Vue, or any frontend framework you prefer.
